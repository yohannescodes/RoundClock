# RoundClock ⏰

**RoundClock** is a SwiftUI app that lets users convert between different units of time measurement with a simple and straightforward UI.

I built this project as a challenge after completing the first SwiftUI project in the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by Hacking with Swift.
